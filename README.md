## CMM (formerly GTA V Mod Mover)
Fully asynchronous mod mover that moves all the modded files from the game folder to the user specified folder (doesn't work if you modded .rpf archives OUTSIDE of the mods folder)
It's whole purpose is to move the mods from one folder to the other, it works ONLY with GTA V files, but it can be used as a file mover
